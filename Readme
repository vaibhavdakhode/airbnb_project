This repository contains Selenium test scenarios using the TestNG framework for two scenarios on the eBay website. These scenarios cover accessing a product via category after applying multiple filters and accessing a product via search.

Scenario 1: Access a Product via Category after Applying Multiple Filters
Steps:
Go to www.ebay.com.
Navigate to Search by category > Electronics > Cell Phones & accessories.
After the page loads, click Cell Phones & Smartphones in the left-hand side navigation section.
Click "See All" (appears under "Shop by brand" or "Shop by Network").
Add 3 filters - screen size, Price, and Item location appearing in the pop-up and click apply.
Verify that the filter tags are applied.
Scenario 2: Access a Product via Search
Steps:
Go to www.ebay.com.
Type any search string in the search bar. For example: MacBook.
Change the Search category to Computers/Tablets & Networking and click Search.
Verify that the page loads completely.
Verify that the first result name matches with the search string.

Running the Test Scenarios
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Update the path to the WebDriver executable in the test scripts (System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "chromedriver.exe");).
